# Airlines-Flights-Dataset
##Description
This project explores the relationship between flight characteristics and ticket prices through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Using Python and data visualization techniques, the analysis focuses on how airline, travel class, number of stops, flight duration, and days left before departure affect airfare.
The main goal of this project is to better understand the key factors that influence flight pricing and to uncover meaningful patterns in airline ticket data.

##Technologies
Pandas – data manipulation
NumPy – numerical computing
Matplotlib – visualization
Seaborn – statistical plotting

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:

##Key Insights from EDA
- Business class tickets are significantly more expensive than economy class.
- Ticket prices increase as the departure date gets closer.
- Flights with more stops are generally cheaper.
- Longer duration flights tend to have higher prices.
- Ticket prices vary noticeably between different airlines.

##Conclusion
This exploratory data analysis shows that flight prices are strongly affected by class, time, and travel conditions.
The findings provide valuable insights for both travelers and analysts interested in airline pricing behavior.
